### Features
- The download button to download .csv file
- The page has a theme
- Table on last tab is searchable and has multiple sub-tabs
- The Histogram changes based on the user's input
- Graph changes based on user's input
- A small meme created from scratch on the side bar


### Notes
- Lots of trubleshooting was involved with the making the code work properly: pictures, tables.
- Took a while to understand the variable transition between ui and the server side.
