# STAT545-hw03-ganelin-ilya

*All the excersices done in accordance with the instructions.*
The homework files located in the main folder with the class excersices.

## Contents:

- ![hw3.rmd](https://github.com/ilgan/STAT545-hw-ganelin-ilya/blob/master/HW3/hw3.rmd) - contains all teh graphs and tables required for the hw3.

- ![hw3.md](https://github.com/ilgan/STAT545-hw-ganelin-ilya/blob/master/HW3/hw3.md) - contains compailed hw3.rmd with the graphs and tables.

- ![hw3.R](https://github.com/ilgan/STAT545-hw-ganelin-ilya/blob/master/HW3/hw3.R) - contains R script, but I mainly worked directly with Rmd file.

## Reporting:

I created the repository and relocated all the files related to HW2, HW3 to single folder (based on the comments from TA). I followed the homework instructions and completed three tasks. Unfortunatley I did not have a time to complete a few more.

I used kable to create tables in more appealing format.

I mainly used the [RMarkdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) for al the questions regarding plots.

Plots also were labeled.
