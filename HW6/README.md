###Notes:
1. I had hard time to work with so many libraries. Some of them cannot be loaded after the other ones, there should be a specific rder. The error messages were not very informative, but thanks to stack overflow I found the solution.
2. Another issue is that there are so many different ways to do the same thing, such as copying, sorting, aggregating, that sometimes I find myself lost. A had to search the solutions online. Only after I decided to work through all the excersices i found that they actually very informative and in my opinion, the HW6 should be devided into at least 2-3 parts so we could go through all the excercises. I personally started with 1, 2, and 3, but found 4 and 5th are the most helpful ones.
3. I understand that it is hard to navigate through my HW6, but the reason for that is that I tried to solve a lot of different parts.
4. HW6 is definitely a bit jump from 545, mostly on the volume of the homework. Since there are no clear instructions on what is concidered to be a complete excersice, it is never ending job by upgrading my answers and trying to solve more. Please be more specific on what should be solved for an A+.

Thank you!
