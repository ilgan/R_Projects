# Data Reshaping

## Activity #1:  Minimal guide to tidyr

This is a minimal guide, mostly for myself, to remind me of the most import tidyr functions **gather** and **spread** functions that I'm familiar with. Also check out [A tidyr Tutorial](http://data.library.virginia.edu/a-tidyr-tutorial/).

Start with installing the package using following commands **install.packages("tidyverse")** or **install.packages("tidyr")**.

We will be using the **gapminder** data as our input.
- Firstly, let's create a data frame to manipulate with:

```{r}
dp <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap),
              n_countries    = length(gdpPercap))

continents <- data.frame(
   continent = dp$continent,
   meanGdp   = dp$mean_gdpPercap,
   n_countries = dp$n_countries)
continents 
```

- The help page for gather says that it “takes multiple columns and collapses into key-value pairs, duplicating all other columns as needed” 

```{r}
continentsG <- gather(data = continents, key = continent, value = meanGdp)
continentsG
```

...or as we call it "melting data".

A picture is worth a thousand words!

## Activity #2: Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.

- A tibble with *year* as a measure, *gdpPercap* as a value for Canada and Australia.
```{r}
leTbl <- select(filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Canada", "Australia")),
      year, country, lifeExp) %>% 
      gather(measure, value, lifeExp) %>% 
      arrange(country, year)
#kable(leTbl, format = "markdown", caption = "Life Expectancy in Canada and Australia")

head(knitr::kable(leTbl))
```

- A scatterplot of life expectancy for Canada against Australia.
```{r}
ggplot(leTbl, aes(x=year, y=value, colour=country))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_continuous("Year") +
  scale_y_continuous("Life Expectancy") +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy in Canada and Australia") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

- We can see from the scatterplot that from 1958 and until 1999 the life expectancy in Canada was higher.


## Activity #3 

- Compute some measure of life expectancy for all possible combinations of continent and year.

```{r}
td.gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
  select (-c(country, pop, gdpPercap)) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  mutate(meanLifeExp=mean(lifeExp)) %>% 
  gather(measure, value, lifeExp)
#knitr::kable(td.gapminder) # Just too long of the output
head(knitr::kable(td.gapminder))
```

- The table summarizes the life expectancy per year per continent


# Join Prompt: Join, Merge, Look up

## Activity #1

- Create a second data frame, complementary to Gapminder. Join this with (part of) Gapminder using a *dplyr* join function and make some observations about the process and result. Explore the different types of joins.

**Dataframe:**
One row per country, a country variable and one or more variables with extra info, such as language spoken, NATO membership, national animal, or capitol city. If you really want to be helpful, you could attempt to make a pull request to resolve this issue, where I would like to bring ISO country codes into the gapminder package.


- I am going to use WDI climate data set.
We start with grabbing GNI per capita data for Chile, Hungary, Uruguay, Mexico, Canada, and USA for years 1952 - 2017.
```{r}
library(WDI)
td.wdi <- WDI(indicator='NY.GDP.PCAP.KD', country=c('MX','CA','US','CL','HU','UY'), start=1952, end=2017) %>% 
  select(-iso2c)
head(knitr::kable(td.wdi))
#or
#View(td.wdi)

td.gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
  select (-c(pop, gdpPercap)) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  mutate(meanLifeExp=mean(lifeExp)) %>% 
  gather(measure, value, lifeExp)

head(knitr::kable(td.gapminder))
```

- Inner Join. 

*Note: the countries that are not in our previously mentioned list in WDI will have NA instead of the values.*

```{r}
td.ij <- inner_join(td.gapminder,td.wdi,by="country")
head(knitr::kable(td.ij))
```

The join result has all variables from td.gapminder plus NY.GDP.PCAP.KD, from td.wdi.

- Full Join

```{r}
td.ij <- full_join(td.gapminder,td.wdi)
head(knitr::kable(td.ij))
```

Here we used full join and kept all the information from both data bases. Note that we joined by both "country" and "year".
