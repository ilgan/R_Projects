#### We start with loading all the necessary general purpose libraries

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(purrr)
library(glue)
library(stringr)
library(purrr)
library(ggmap)
library(knitr)
```

#### Libraries for web scraping

``` r
library(rvest)
library(xml2)
library(httr)
library(leaflet)
```

#### Working with the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com)

``` r
get_movie <- function(title, year, key){
    query_string <- glue("http://www.omdbapi.com/?t={title}&y={year}&apikey={key}")
    movie_result <- httr::GET(query_string)
    movie_content <- as.data.frame(content(movie_result))
    return(movie_content)
}
```

#### Start with requesting the information of one of the movies you would like to see. For testing purposes only use your key. you can request it [here](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).

``` r
movie_info <- get_movie("babe", "1995","33ffee5e")
typeof(movie_info)
```

    ## [1] "list"

``` r
knitr::kable(movie_info)
```

#### Plot the Movie's of interest Location using ggmap and leaflet.

``` r
get_movie_location <- function(movie_info){
    countries <- str_split(movie_info$Country, ",")
    loc <- geocode(as.character(countries))
    m <- leaflet() %>%
        addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
        addMarkers(lng=loc$lon, lat=loc$lat, popup="Movie Location")
    return(m)
}

map <- get_movie_location(movie_info)

#### Expand our function to output multiple

#### Let's see the result.

We start with creating a list of the movies we would like to download info for. , include=FALSE

#### This is a current weather request at the location of the movie. Use your key from [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).

The functions reads the data frame that we aquired earlier from the movie data set, then it calls the weather API and gets the current weather report for that location. Easy, but powerful!

``` r
current_weather <- function(movie_info, key){
    countries <- str_split(movie_info$Country, ",")
    loc <- geocode(as.character(countries))
    lat <- loc$lat
    lon <- loc$lon
    query_string <- glue("api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={key}")
    weather_result <- httr::GET(query_string)
    weather_content <- content(weather_result)
    movie_content <- as.data.frame(weather_content$weather)
    return(movie_content)
}
